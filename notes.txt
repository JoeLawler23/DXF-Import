Potential Options for pre-written modules:
    1) dxfgrabber (https://dxfgrabber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ** Outdated and has been replaced by ezdxf **
    2) ezdxf (https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/index.html) (https://github.com/mozman/ezdxf)

Next Steps:
    1) Create import csv function
    2) Create import txt function

Implemented Geometries:
        LINE - DONE just need to test
        CIRCLE - DONE/TESTED
        ARC - DONE just need to test
        ELLIPSE - DONE just need to test
        LWPOLYLINE - Done just need to test
        SPLINE - Done just need to test

Notimplemented Geometries:
        POINT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save sketch points to a DXF file
        POLYLINE - ** can'test, this is an older geometry type which Fusion does not support
        3DFACE - A 3D solid filled triangle/quadrilateral ** can't create in Fusion 
        SOLID - A 2D/3D solid filled triangle/quadrilateral ** can't create in Fusion
        TRACE - A solid filled triangle/quadrilateral **
        SHAPE - Stored in .shx files and are used like block references ** don't need to worry about
        MESH - A 3D plane with vertices ** can't create in Fusion
        ATTRIB - A tag ** can't create in Fusion  
        ATTDEF - Attribute definition for storing data in a block ** don't need to worry about
        TEXT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save text under the TEXT header but rather as a series of lines and lwpolylines
        MTEXT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save text under the TEXT header but rather as a series of lines and lwpolylines
        HATCH - fills an area based on given geometries ** don't need to worry about

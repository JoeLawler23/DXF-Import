Potential Options for pre-written modules:
    1) dxfgrabber (https://dxfgrabber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ** Outdated and has been replaced by ezdxf **
    2) ezdxf (https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/index.html)

Next Steps:
    1) Go through all geometries and implement
    2) Create test file(s) for all geometries
    3) Test all geometries

    1) Test importing txt function
    2) Create import csv function

        CIRCLE - DONE/TESTED
        ARC - DONE/TESTED
        ELLIPSE - DONE/TESTED

Not-implemented DXF Geometries:
        POINT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save sketch points to a DXF file
        POLYLINE - ** can'test, this is an older geometry type which Fusion does not support
        3DFACE - A 3D solid filled triangle/quadrilateral ** can't create in Fusion 
        SOLID - A 2D/3D solid filled triangle/quadrilateral ** can't create in Fusion
        TRACE - A solid filled triangle/quadrilateral **
        SHAPE - Stored in .shx files and are used like block references ** don't need to worry about
        MESH - A 3D plane with vertices ** can't create in Fusion
        ATTRIB - A tag ** can't create in Fusion  
        ATTDEF - Attribute definition for storing data in a block ** don't need to worry about
        TEXT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save text under the TEXT header but rather as a series of lines and lwpolylines
        MTEXT - ** can't create as Fusion does not save text under the TEXT header but rather as a series of lines and lwpolylines
        HATCH - fills an area based on given geometries ** don't need to worry about

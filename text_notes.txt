# Add basic punctuation (How should I deal with points? POINT)
# Add scalability as a size param no units seperate horizontal and vertical scale factor
# Add spaces as fixed size param
# Account for characaters that are not in default
# Default data inside program read in from file for custom letters/strings
# Break up complex geometries into small lines (quality param either min length or number of segments or default break based on length)
# Add into geometry importer repo
# Try demo mode for Autolaze

Create function to convert all geometries to lines
Add filter to functions so that only geometries that you want are imported (string as filter)
Convert all other functions to a series of lines

A string to determine geometries u want to output
A flag would be whether to convert the geometries to the accepted geometries

Add one wrapper function and keep the individual functions

Add implementation for extra geometries in csv and txt

Automate testing in github

Add support for points

Look at changes made to the importer library in Autolaze
